# bitwiser
A Meteor project designed to help make you a "bitwiser".

On my Linux machine there is already a "programming" calculator that allows be to make all sorts of different bitwise operations on binary and hexidecimal numbers,
but I like pretty things, so I've decided to make an app that does all these calculations but in a pretty way.

Here is my app for you to play with, fork it, and feel free to make pull requests if you've made any improvements!
